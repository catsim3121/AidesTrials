#Instructions

Three new preventative aides drugs were tested in clinical trials in 2015. The trial designs were modeled after the famous RV_144 Aides Trials in Tailand in 2009.  Analyze and report on the apparent effectiveness of the three different drugs. Does sex of the participant seem to be a factor for any of the drugs?

# Methods 

The data for the Aides Trials is large having about 14,000 observations and 4 variables. I will be only looking at two variables, group and sex for this report. There are three sets of data divided by region, South Carolina, Central Africa and Korea. Korea has 4,924 observations, South Carolina has 4,400 observations and Central Africa has 4,924 observations. 

Variable analysis: 

Group is a factor variable with two levels: drug and placebo

Sex is a factor variable with two levels: male and female 


Since two factor variables are being compared, the best way to view the data graphically would be by bar charts and the best way to view the data numerically would be by two-way tables. The last part that will be included is the inferential tests using the t test. 

# South Carolina

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.


# Central Africa

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.



# Korea

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.
